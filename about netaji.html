                <h2>Civil Service Exams:-</h2>
                <p><i>Bose appeared for the Indian Civil Service (ICS) examinations in 1920 and stood fourth in the
                        order of merit. However,<u><mark> he resigned from the coveted position in protest against the
                                oppressive British rule following the Jallianwala Bagh massacre in 1919.</mark></u></i>

                <p><i>Bose became actively involved in the Indian National Congress and the independence

                                nonviolent resistance.</u></mark> Bose rose through the ranks of the Indian National
                        Congress quickly, becoming the president of the All India Youth Congress and the Bengal
                        Congress. His radical approach and strong belief in direct action sometimes brought him into
                        conflict with the more moderate leaders of the Congress.</i></p>

                        However, his differences with the Congress leadership, particularly with Gandhi and Jawaharlal
                        Nehru, led to his resignation from the presidency in 1939.</i></p>

                <h2>The Indian National Army (INA):-</h2>

                <h3>Lost The Hero:-</h3>
                <p><i> Bose's fate remains a matter of debate. It's widely believed that he died in a plane crash in
                        Taiwan on August 18, 1945. However, conspiracy theories suggest that he may have survived and
                        lived in secrecy after the war.</i></p>
